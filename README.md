The code above is just a dice guessing game on which a player is a winner,
depending on the number shown on the dice.

so let us say!
-player one choose two on the dice
-then player two chooses six on the dice
-now in this scenario player two is a winner.

The code is basically written in html and javaScript so you just need to clone the repository and run directly to your computer.

-The contents are based on the lessons tought by Dr. Angela Yu from the appbrew
